      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, one of my colleagues approached me and asked a question about how to exec a command in a pod with client-go. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answer and I noticed that I had never thought about the mechanism in &amp;ldquo;kubectl exec&amp;rdquo;. I had some ideas about how it should be, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t 100% sure. I noted the topic to check again and I have learnt a lot after reading some blogs, docs and source codes. In this blog post, I am going to share my understanding and findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please ping me if there is something wrong. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/erkan_erol_&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/erkan_erol_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, a few times,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I became one of the main maintainers of the project/a component after a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I helped new people to adapt to the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies were different. The teams were different. The technology stacks were different. However, I realized my approach was similar. I think I can say some things about adapting to a software project. In this blog post, I am going to share &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
