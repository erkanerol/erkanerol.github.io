&lt;p&gt;+Hi Erkan. Pod-X in my cluster is in CrashLoopBackOff. How can I solve this issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ohh:/ Most probably it is because of the known EKS issue. Just restart the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Just delete the pod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+Really? May I delete any pod in my cluster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-In theory, you can delete any pod of our application. Nevertheless, be careful :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how many times I had this conversation, but I have never thought about whether pods are really restartable or not until recently. When I thought about it deeply, &lt;strong&gt;I noticed that pods are not fully restartable, they are re-creatable or partially restartable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answer and I noticed that I had never thought about the mechanism in &amp;ldquo;kubectl exec&amp;rdquo;. I had some ideas about how it should be, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t 100% sure. I noted the topic to check again and I have learnt a lot after reading some blogs, docs and source codes. In this blog post, I am going to share my understanding and findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I became one of the main maintainers of the project/a component after a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I helped new people to adapt to the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies were different. The teams were different. The technology stacks were different. However, I realized my approach was similar. I think I can say some things about adapting to a software project. In this blog post, I am going to share &amp;ldquo;my way&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
