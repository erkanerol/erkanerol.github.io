&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why this book now? Well, we’ve overloaded our profession with resources. There is more information available about our revolution than any one person can absorb. Still, some people manage to do it. They internalize all the advice available to them and always seem to have it close at hand. How do they do achieve that level of mastery? This book is full of patterns for mastering our complex field. Mastering is more than just knowing. It is knowing in a way that lightens your load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
TL;DR Şu kitabı her yazılımcının okuması gerektiğine inanıyorum ve şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://erkanerol.github.io/img/apprenticeship-cover.png&#34; title=&#34;Apprenticeship Patterns&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tanıtım:c384b087910c43172fdcea43b3e304eb&#34;&gt;Tanıtım&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benim gözümde yazılımcılar ikiye ayrılıyor.
1. Para karşılığı bir süre kod yazan ve 40 yaşında kod yazmak istemeyenler.
+Para vermeselerde kod yazacak olan ve 40 yaşında bile kod yazmaktan kopmak istemeyenler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bu kitap 2. kategori yazılımcı olmak isteyen çıraklar için bire bir. Meslek hayatının belirli dönemlerinde, belirli durumlarda yapılması gerekenlere dair tavsiyeler içeriyor. Bir çok yazılımcının tecrübelerinden yola çıkarak hazırlanan bu kitabın içinde bir çok şablon bulunuyor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Örnek olması açısında &amp;ldquo;Find Mentors&amp;rdquo; isimli şablonun özetini çıkardım:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context:  Yürüdüğünüz yoldan daha önce geçenlerin olduğunu farkettiniz ve yolunuzu aramak için çok fazla zaman kaybediyorsunuz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem: Yürüdüğünüz yolda tek başınasınız ve önünüzü göremiyorsunuz. Yardıma ve rehberliğe ihtiyacınız var.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: Size çıraklığa kabul edecek ustalar bulun ve mentörünüz olmalarını isteyin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action: Bir aracın, kütüphanenin veya topluluğun mail grubuna katılın. Bir süre pusuya yatın ve gözlemleyin. Yeteri derecede olaylara hakim olduktan sonra etkinliklerine katılın ve size mentörlük edebileceğini düşündüğünüz ustalardan &amp;ldquo;informal&amp;rdquo; mentörlük talep edin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Also: &amp;ldquo;The Deep End&amp;rdquo; ve &amp;ldquo;The Long Road&amp;rdquo; isimli şablonlara da bakabilirsiniz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kitapta-bulunan-bütün-şablonlar:c384b087910c43172fdcea43b3e304eb&#34;&gt;Kitapta Bulunan Bütün Şablonlar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://erkanerol.github.io/img/apprenticeship-patterns.png&#34; title=&#34;Apprenticeship Patterns&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;kişisel-yorumlarım:c384b087910c43172fdcea43b3e304eb&#34;&gt;Kişisel Yorumlarım&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben kitaptaki bir çok şablonun benim durumuma uyduğunu gördüm ve çözüm önerilerini çok mantıklı buldum. Elimden geldiğince uygulamaya çalışacağım. Bu kitap aslında sadece belirli durumlara ilişkin yapılacaklar listesi değil. Kitabın tamamını okuduğunuzda yazılım alanında nasıl iyi bir yazılımcı olunabileceğine dair bir fikriniz oluyor. Mesleki gelişimin usûl esaslarını tanımlıyor ki usûlü esastan her daim önde tutan biri olarak ( bkz: usûl esasa mukaddemdir) benim en sevdiğim kısmı bu oldu. Yani kitap size şu kitapları okuyun demiyor, hangi kitapları okumanız gerektiğini nasıl anlayacağınızı anlatıyor. Yazılım geliştirmenin sadece bir dil/framework/kütüphane/araç bilmek olmadığını, işin ciddi bir felsefesi olduğunu anlamak açısından da oldukça faydalı. Bu arada bunları bilmenin ne kadar önemli olduğuna dair pek çok şablon var. Öyle kuru felsefeyle kalma diyor yani :) Benim yorumlamam bu kadar. Aşağıda altını çizdiğim bazı yerler var.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paylaşım linkleri aşağıda mevcuttur. Bu kitap çok önemli. Elden ele yayalım :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;alıntılarım-spoiler:c384b087910c43172fdcea43b3e304eb&#34;&gt;Alıntılarım (SPOILER!!!)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprentices are people who are willing to take on a junior role that maximizes their learning opportunities, as opposed to people who try to climb as quickly as they can into roles that maximize their financial opportunities. In my experience, if the apprentice has talent and the right attitude, their financial success will inevitably follow their learning success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure is inevitable. It happens to everybody sooner or later. In fact, someone who has never failed at anything has either avoided pushing at the boundaries of their abilities or has learned to overlook their own mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with masters is the best way to learn a craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I want to change the way people think about programming,” Kent said. I agreed. We both wanted to reverse what we thought had been a wrong turn in the progress of our industry. And, amazingly, we did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humility is one of the foundations of a successful apprenticeship. Combined with ambition, humility will help keep you focused and progressing in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is written for software apprentices—for people who have had a taste of developing software and want to take it further, but need some guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An apprenticeship is a season in your career when your focus is more on your own growth than almost anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other books we would recommend for people in those roles, but this book is for people at the beginning of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest patterns are the ones that are applied productively over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the advice that has come out of our revolution does not help much until it becomes second nature. The craftsmanship movement in software recognizes that making this stuff second nature isn’t, well, second nature. These patterns are a welcome contribution to this progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He who knows not and knows not that he knows not, is a fool — shun him!
He who knows not and knows that he knows not, is unlearned — teach him!
He who knows and knows not that he knows, is asleep — awaken him!
He who knows and knows that he knows, is enlightened — follow him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pattern is a named description of a recurring solution to a problem in a given context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterns are meant to be open to modification to fit your circumstances rather than mechanically applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all pattern languages, you should be careful not to overuse these patterns. Don’t look for excuses to use every single pattern, but instead pick and choose the most appropriate set for your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey discussed here starts with “Hello world!”, but where does it end? Far too often, it ends with a promotion to middle management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey discussed here starts with “Hello world!”, but where does it end? Far too often, it ends with a promotion to middle management. Too many talented people thoughtlessly take that promotion and find themselves just a few years later in jobs they don’t enjoy and yearning for retirement. But for those who have a knack for developing software and enjoy the learning process, software development is a career that can last a lifetime, and it can be a great ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any programmer proficient in his first language, it’s always a temptation to fall back to the standards and idioms of your native language when you’re learning a new language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is not simply to hand people a rule book, but to give them the ability to create new practices for new contexts, which in turn drives the discipline of software development forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attachment to Carol Dweck’s research, which calls for a “growth mindset.” This entails a belief that you can be better and everything can be improved if you’re prepared to work at it. In her words, “effort is what makes you smart or talented” (Mindset, p. 16), and failure is merely an incentive to try a different approach next time. It is the opposite of the belief that we’re all born with a given amount of talent, and that failure is an indication that you don’t have enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A need to always be adapting and changing based on the feedback you get from the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A desire to be pragmatic rather than dogmatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A belief that it is better to share what we know than to create scarcity by hoarding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A willingness to experiment and be proven wrong. This means we try stuff. We fail. Then we use the lessons from that failure in the next experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dedication to what psychologists call an internal locus of control.[6] This involves taking control of and responsibility for our destinies rather than just waiting for someone else to give us the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we think that a useful system should be able to identify and absorb the best ideas from all elements of the software development community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I guess it basically means having the attitude that there’s always a better/smarter/faster way to do what you just did and what you’re currently doing. Apprenticeship is the state/process of evolving and looking for better ways and finding people, companies and situations that force you to learn those better/smarter/faster ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is not an internal quantity that is fed by easy successes and diminished by failures&amp;hellip;. It is not something we give to people by telling them about their high intelligence. It is something we equip them to get for themselves—by teaching them to value learning over the appearance of smartness, to relish challenge and to use errors as routes to mastery”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you must learn to grow yourself, to learn how you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, an apprentice is approached by a master or a journeyman and told that her work and her role in the community are that of a journeyman. In such a case, the apprentice had previously begun taking on more responsibilities, and like a “boiled frog” had made a gradual but not discrete transition from one state to another. That transition may take longer for some people than for others. For some, the transition may take longer than their professional careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journeyman’s responsibilities are wider than those of an apprentice. As such his failures can do more harm. Some of the patterns we will discuss are not appropriate for a journeyman, precisely because he has a greater responsibility to others who may see him as a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might be facing overbearing and/or incompetent managers, de-motivated coworkers, impossible deadlines, and work environments that treat novice developers like workhorses, storing them in small, rectangular stalls with a PC and a crippled Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more experience you already have, the more effort you will need to put into “emptying your cup,” clearing your mind of bad habits, setting aside the pride you have in your skills, and opening yourself up to the different, often counterintuitive, approaches of your more experienced colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental ways to improve the experience of learning your first language is to have an actual problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to learn a language on your own, but it takes a long time to learn the spirit of a language unless you interact with experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One danger of digging deep into your first language is getting stuck. It likely will remain with you throughout your career as your native tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprentices comfortable with an object-oriented language should explore a functional programming language. Apprentices comfortable with dynamic typing should explore static typing. Apprentices comfortable with server-side programming should explore user interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t be wedded to any particular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;never stopping to think that the freedom to be foolish might well be one of the keys to the genius’s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find an opportunity to unlearn something. Ideally, this would be something that forces you to put aside your previous experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask that person to explain some of the misconceptions that people from your particular background usually have about their community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite (and because of!) your inexperience, you bring some unique attributes to your team, including an infectious enthusiasm. Do not allow anyone to dampen your excitement for the craft—it is a precious commodity and will accelerate your learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They either repress their enthusiasm altogether, or allow it to manifest only outside of their day jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehension can be increased if more levels of experience are connected, as when newcomers who take nothing for granted interrelate more often with old-timers who think they have seen it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craftsmen learn from the apprentices, even as the apprentices learn from them. Enthusiastic beginners not only renew the craftsmen, but also challenge the craftsmen by bringing in new ideas from the outside. A well chosen apprentice can make even a master craftsman more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collect the CVs of people whose skills you respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research by the social psychologist Carol Dweck, the need to appear competent is ingrained into people of most industrialized societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software craftsmen build their reputations through strong relationships with their clients and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expertise is a by-product of the long road we’re all on, but it is not the destination. Over the course of their journey, craftsmen will work with countless technologies and domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as an apprentice with aspirations to mastery, you need to be willing to Expose Your Ignorance as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that learning in public is one of the ways in which an apprentice begins the transition to journeyman. It’s a small step from learning where people can see you to teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the distinguishing facets of the craft approach is a willingness to put the wider interests of your community before your own, rather than using the team and the client to further your personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new knowledge you have may reveal gaps you hadn’t noticed before; don’t forget to add these things to your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your responsibility to offset the risks of this approach by Finding Mentors and Kindred Spirits who can provide help when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave saw that although these exceptional people were miles ahead of him, they were all walking the same road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should keep in mind the expectation that you will be a working software developer even when you are middle-aged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rather than counting the days to retirement, the craftsman will willingly and joyfully work into her final decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that 40 years from now you are asked to write a short description of your professional history and the biggest influences on your path. Use the output from that thought experiment to help you plan your future career choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things we build for customers can be beautiful, but must be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;utility and beauty are not opposed, but interdependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you will make the wrong trade-off, and fixing that mistake by rewriting the system from scratch may not be in the customer’s best interest. In those situations you will need to develop the ability to refactor and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever seen a programmer at work&amp;hellip;knows that programming itself, if the programmer is given the chance to do it his way, is the biggest motivation in programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to learn something new, but what I already know pays too well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mother might think you deserve it, but impressive titles and responsibilities do not indicate that your apprenticeship is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;more time with your family or more money, or perhaps a new vocation has captured your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If and when they came back, we welcomed them with open arms because those experiences had given them new perspectives they could share. Sadly, conventional software organizations may not be so welcoming. They often see these detours as suspicious gaps in your career that you must justify. They will expect you to have a rationale that makes sense within their value system for why you left and why you’re coming back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be the lion’s tail rather than the fox’s head!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational cultures that encourage software craftsmanship are rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Hunt, a highly respected software craftsman, has asserted numerous times that software development is composed of two primary activities: learning and communication&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would build on that idea and assert that the core theme of an apprenticeship is learning and the dominant trait of a successful apprentice is a demonstration of her learning abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only people who achieve much are those who want knowledge so badly that they seek it while the conditions are still unfavourable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprentices are thirsty for opportunities to replace their ignorance with skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good way to ensure you have interesting exercises to use in your practice sessions is to trawl through old books like Programming Pearls, More Programming Pearls, or Etudes for Programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, maintaining a wiki can teach you about HTTP, REST, parsing, web design, caching, full-text search, databases, and concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your notebook, blog, or wiki should be a nursery, not a graveyard—lessons should be born from this record, rather than going there to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in your apprenticeship, develop the habit of regularly sharing the lessons you have learned. This may take the form of maintaining a blog or running “brown bag” sessions amongst your Kindred Spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, teaching is a powerful learning tool for the person doing the teaching, perhaps even more so than for the students. Thus the old saying “When one person teaches, two people learn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ingenuity is often misunderstood. It is not a matter of superior intelligence but of character. It demands more than anything a willingness to recognize failure, to not paper over the cracks, and to change. It arises from deliberate, even obsessive, reflection on failure and a constant searching for new solutions. —Atul Gawande, Better&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to intermingle classics with modern, pragmatic books and/or articles in your Reading List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the next time someone talks to you about Representation State Transfer, better known as REST, you should take that as an excuse to read Roy Fielding’s PhD thesis in which he defined the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armed with your deeper knowledge of HTTP, try to implement a client and a server for RFC 707.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can guarantee that the tools you use as an apprentice will be obsolete by the time you become a journeyman. In time, all of your favorite tools will become junk. For your career to prosper, you must learn to acquire and abandon familiar tools with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say that something is a craft, one of the things we mean is that it is a discipline and a tradition that places a high value on skill. This includes acquiring, growing, and eventually transmitting that skill. We believe true mastery is shown in the effect you have on others by transmitting your superior skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In software development, we don’t know exactly what constitutes mastery, but we do know what it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an apprentice, you should aim to become better than your teachers. And if they are good teachers, they should try to help you achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mere genius is not mastery, but if a person is able to train others to equal or surpass her genius, then it becomes evident that person is a potential master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;==========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there are no masters&amp;hellip;yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Startup Playbook (Ekitap halinde)</title>
      <link>https://erkanerol.github.io/post/startup-playbook/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2015 21:43:13 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://erkanerol.github.io/post/startup-playbook/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Y Combinator Startup&amp;rsquo;lara yatırım yapan ve danışmanlık yapan bir şirket. Şirket çalışanlarından Sam Altman tecrübelerinden yola çıkarak yazdığı kısa bir Playbook yayınladı. Şu adresten okuyabileceğiniz yazıyı ekitap haline getirdim. Yazının sonundan dosyaları indirebilirsiniz.Altını çizdiğim yerler de aşağıda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://erkanerol.github.io/img/startup-playbook-cover.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your goal as a startup is to make something users love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A word of warning about choosing to start a startup: It sucks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To have a successful startup, you need: a great idea (including a great market), a great team, a great product, and great execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the idea does not really excite at least some people the first time they hear it, that’s bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also ask how the company will one day be a monopoly. There are a lot of different terms for this, but we use Peter Thiel’s. Obviously, we don’t want your company to behave in an unethical way against competitors. Instead, we’re looking for businesses that get more powerful with scale and that are difficult to copy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you don’t have an idea but want to start a startup? Maybe you shouldn’t. It’s so much better if the idea comes first and the startup is the way to get the idea out into the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think part of the problem is that good founders tend to have lots of good ideas (too many, usually).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech startups need at least one founder who can build the company’s product or service, and at least one founder who is (or can become) good at sales and talking to users. This can be the same person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is the secret to success: have a great product. This is the only thing all great companies have in common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to get very close to your users. Literally watch them use your product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to plan too far out, and definitely don’t batch everything into one big public release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only universal job description of a CEO is to make sure the company wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prime directive of great execution is “Never lose momentum”. But how do you do it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extreme internal transparency around metrics (and financials) is a good thing to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The common mistake here is to focus on signups and ignore retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A related trap is thinking about problems too far in the future—i.e. “How are we going to do this at massive scale?” The answer is to figure it out when you get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that sales and marketing are not bad words. Though neither will save you if you don’t have a great product, they can both help accelerate growth substantially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who let themselves make a lot of excuses usually fail in general, and startup CEOs who do it almost always fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A huge part of being a successful startup CEO is not giving up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My first piece of advice about hiring is don’t do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, fire quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But 99% of startups die from suicide, not murder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Henry Ford: “The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time.”&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch your cash flow obsessively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The secret to successfully raising money is to have a good company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors are driven by the dual fears of missing the next Google, and fear of losing money on something that in retrospect looks obviously stupid. (For the best companies, they fear both at the same time.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that at least a thousand people have every great idea. One of them actually becomes successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR O&amp;rsquo;Reilly sitesinden ücretsiz indirebileceğiniz kısa,güzel bir kitabın özeti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://erkanerol.github.io/img/software_design_cover.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geçenlerde Hacker News üzerinden bulduğum bir yazıyı okurken sağ tarafta ücretsiz ekitap indirebileceğime dair bir şey görünce beleşçiliğim tuttu ve kitabı (mobi formatı da var 👏) indirdim. Kitabın temel uygulama mimarilerini uzatmadan (pdf versiyonu 55 sayfa) anlatması çok hoşuma gitti ve okudum. Benim için çok faydalı olduğunu söyleyebilirim. Bir çok terim öğrendim. Buradan önermeye karar verdim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitapta 5 ana mimariden söz ediliyor. Böyle bir mimari neden var, ne zaman gerekir, temel olarak nasıl çalışır kısaca anlatılmış. Her bölümün sonunda o bölümde anlatılan mimari belirli (Overall Agility, Deployment, Testability, Performance, Scalibility, Development) açılardan değerlendirilmiş. Mimari görselleri, değerlendirme tablosu ve kitabın linki aşağıda. İyi okumalar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gölgede ve Güneşte Futbol - Eduardo Galeano</title>
      <link>https://erkanerol.github.io/post/golgede-ve-guneste-futbol/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2015 20:41:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://erkanerol.github.io/post/golgede-ve-guneste-futbol/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR   Kitabı okudum,beğendim.Tavsiye ediyorum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uzun betimlemelerden,derin analizlerden,anlaşılması güç metaforlardan yorulmuştum. Okuması kolay bir kitap arıyordum. Zihnimi yormayacak ama saçma sapan da olmayacak. Meritokrasi listemi gezerken Eduardo Galeano&amp;rsquo;nun Gölgede ve Güneşte Futbol isimli kitabı dikkatimi çekti. Kitabın girişindeki şu bölümü okuyunca Ntvspor&amp;rsquo;da  Bağış Erten ve Banu Yelkovan&amp;rsquo;ın sunduğu programının adının nereden esinlendiğini anlamış oldum ve tamamen okumaya karar verdim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okuyacağınız sayfalar, yıllar önce Calella de la Costa&amp;rsquo;da karşılaştığım çocuklara ithaf edilmiştir. Futbol oynamaktan dönen o çocuklar bir şarkı tutturmuşlardı:   &amp;ldquo;Yensek de, yenilsek de, değişmez eğlencemiz&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://erkanerol.github.io/img/golgede-guneste-futbol-kapak.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitap beklediğimden güzel çıktı. Galeano Uruguaylı sosyalist bir yazar. Ve bir futbol tutkunu. Futbola ortalama bir entelektüel gibi bakmıyor ve durumu şöyle ifade ediyor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futbol, Tanrıya ne yönüyle benzer? Hemen söyleyeyim: Birçok insanın ona inanmasıyla ve entelektüellerin ona kuşkuyla yaklaşmasıyla.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ben basit bir &amp;lsquo;iyi futbol dilencisiyim&amp;rsquo;. Elimde şapkam, dünyanın dört bir yanını geziyor ve stadyumlarda yalvarıyorum: &amp;lsquo;Tanrı rızası için, güzel bir maç lütfen.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitabın başında futbolun ögeleri üzerine yorumlar var.Oyuncu,kaleci,yıldız,taraftar,teknik direktör,fanatik,hakem vb. Sonra biraz futbolun tarihinden söz ediyor Galeano. Kitap boyunca sık sık endüstriyel futboldan yakınıyor ve aslında eskiye nazaran estetikten yoksun ve makineleşmiş bir oyun izlediğimizden söz ediyor. Dediklerine bakılacak olursa oyun seneler içinde çok değişmiş.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yirminci yüzyılda futbolun öyküsü olarak kabul edilen ve cesaretten korkuya doğru katedilen mesafe, esasında 2-3-5&amp;rsquo;ten yola çıkılarak, 4-3-3, 4-4-2 üzerinden 5-4-1&amp;rsquo;e varışın öyküsüdür.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yukarıda bahsettiğim gibi Galeano bir sosyalist ve futbola dair siyasal perspektifli bir çok yorumu kitapta mevcut. FIFA&amp;rsquo;yı zalim bir devlet ve FIFA başkanlarını birer diktatör gibi anlatıyor kitap boyunca.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;FIFA futbolcularla muhatap olmaz,&amp;rdquo; diye cevap verdi Blatter. &amp;ldquo;Onlar kulüplerin işçileridir.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;João Havelange dünya futbolunun tahtından inerken yerine krallığın en kıdemli saraylısı Joseph Blatter kuruluyordu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitabın devamı Dünya Kupaları tarihi gibi biraz. 1930&amp;rsquo;dan başlayarak günümüze doğru kupaları birer birer anlatıyor yazar ve her kupada öne çıkan maçları,takımları,yıldızları edebi bir dil ile aktarıyor bize. Kupalardan söz etmeden önce Dünya&amp;rsquo;nın o anki durumundan da bahsediyor.Kupa tarihine paralel bir Dünya tarihi mevcut sizin anlayacağınız. Fidel Castro ile ilgili olan kısım 1962&amp;rsquo;den 2010 kadar hep aynı kalması benim en çok ilgimi  çeken kısım oldu. 2002 anlatımlarında Türkiye de var ama açıkçası ben daha çok bahsetmesini beklerdim. Elediğimiz Senegal&amp;rsquo;i daha çok anlatmış :( Aşağıdaki paragraf 1978 Dünya Kupası&amp;rsquo;nın giriş bölümü.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almanya&amp;rsquo;da halkın sevgilisi kaplumbağa Volkswagen, dönemini kapatırken İngiltere&amp;rsquo;de ilk tüp bebek dünyaya geliyordu. İtalya&amp;rsquo;da da çocuk düşürme yasallaşıyordu. Yüzyılın vebası AIDS ilk kurbanlarını veriyordu. Kızıl Tugaylar Aldo Moro&amp;rsquo;yu katlederlerken, Amerika Birleşik Devletleri yüzyılın başından beri kullandığı kanalı Panama&amp;rsquo;ya devretme vaadinde bulunuyordu. Miami&amp;rsquo;deki güvenilir kaynaklardan gelen haberlere bakılırsa Fidel Castro her an devrilebilirdi. Nikaragua&amp;rsquo;da Somoza&amp;rsquo;nın iktidarı son buluyor, İran&amp;rsquo;da da şahın saltanatı sallanıyordu. Guatemala&amp;rsquo;da askerler Panzos Köyünde halkı mitralyözlerle tarıyorlardı. Domitila Barrios, Bolivya&amp;rsquo;nın askeri diktatörüne karşı bakır madenlerinde çalışan dört kadınla birlikte açlık grevine başlıyor ve bütün Bolivya&amp;rsquo;nın onu desteklemesi üzerine diktatör devriliyordu. Arjantin&amp;rsquo;deki diktatörlük yerinde saymaya devam ederken, sanki gücünü kanıtlamak istercesine On Birinci Dünya Futbol Şampiyonasına ev sahipliği yapıyordu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bu da 2010 girişinden bir paragraf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;İsrail, dünyada antisemitizmin dehşet verici sonuçlarının sorumluları, kendileri de Sami olan Filistinlilermişçesine yürüttüğü ve Filistinlileri cezalandırmayı hedefleyen alışılmış suç eylemlerinden birinde, Filistin&amp;rsquo;e yiyecek, ilaç ve oyuncak götüren gemileri uluslararası sularda makinalı tüfeklerle tarıyordu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neyse lafı uzatmayayım. Kitabı tavsiye ediyorum. Son olarak altını çizdiğim bir kaç yeri paylaşıyorum. Tamamı &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1386715632?type=review&#34;&gt;burada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artık daha çok koşuluyor, ama daha az riske giriliyor. Çünkü cesaret kâr sağlamamaktadır. 54 Dünya Kupası ile 94 Dünya Kupası arasında geçen kırk yılda atılan gollerin sayısında önemli bir azalma görülmektedir; bu sayı şimdi yarıya düşmüştür, bu yüzden 1994&amp;rsquo;te beraberlikleri azaltmak amacıyla galibiyetlere iki puan yerine üç puan verilmesi karara bağlandı.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoolog Roberto Fontanarrosa&amp;rsquo;nın dediği gibi, Pandalar ve forvet oyuncuları soyları tükenmekte olan türler!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kendisi gibi Brezilyalı olan ünlü topçu Pelé&amp;rsquo;den bile daha fazla gol attı, profesyonel futbolun en fazla gol atan oyuncusu Brezilyalı Pelé 1.279 gol atmıştı. Friedenreich&amp;rsquo;in ise 1.329 golü vardı.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buna rağmen hiçbir Uruguaylı yoktur ki kendini futbolda taktik ve strateji uzmanı ve futbol tarihi konusunda bilgin saymasın.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerçekten böyle bir insan varmış :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindistan tarihinde ilk kez bir kadın iktidara geliyordu: İndira Gandi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
